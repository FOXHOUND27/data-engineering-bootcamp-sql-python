# 📅 Day 1: April 19, 2025

## ✅ What I Did

- Practiced Filtering using ORDER BY and TOP
- Completed 2 SQL Leetcode questions.
- Wrote a simple Python script with lists and dictionaries.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- SQL: `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `TOP`,
- Python: learned basic python syntax

## ⚠️ Errors Faced

- SQL Server error: Learned that adventureWorksOLTP is based on TSQL and does not have limit
  but instead uses top to restrict the number of rows I request for.
- Python: forgot quotes in dictionary keys

## 🎯 Next Goal

- SQL: Learn about `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`
- Python: Learn about Variables, Data types, Lists, Loops
