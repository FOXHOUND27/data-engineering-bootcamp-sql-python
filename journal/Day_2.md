## üß† Key Concepts

- SQL: `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `TOP`,
- Python: learned `DICTIONERIES`,`FUNCTIONS`,`VARIABLES`,`DATATYPES`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Errors Faced

- SQL Server error: Learned that adventureWorksOLTP is based on TSQL and does not have limit
  but instead uses top to restrict the number of rows I request for.
