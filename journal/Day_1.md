# 📅 Day 1: April 18, 2025

## ✅ What I Did

- Practiced basic SQL SELECT statements using AdventureWorks
- Wrote a simple Python script with lists and dictionaries

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- SQL: `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`,`LIKE`,`BETWEEN`
- Python: `sum()`, working with `dict` and `list`

## ⚠️ Errors Faced

- SQL Server error: Used Double qoutes instead of single qoutes for my where clause and got an error
- Python: forgot quotes in dictionary keys

## 🎯 Next Goal

- SQL: Learn about `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT`
- Python: Learn about `for` loops and `if` conditions
