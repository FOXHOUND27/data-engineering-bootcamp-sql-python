# SQL ORDER BY Clause - Tutorial

## üìå What is ORDER BY?

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to **sort the result set** of a SQL query **in ascending or descending order** based on one or more columns.

By default, SQL sorts results in **ascending order (ASC)**.

---

## üß† Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];
```

# SQL LIMIT Clause - Tutorial

## üìå What is LIMIT?

The `LIMIT` clause is used to **restrict the number of rows** returned in the result of a SQL query.

It‚Äôs especially useful when:

- You want to preview data
- You only need top N results
- You are working with large datasets

---

## üß† Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;
```

# üìò T-SQL `TOP` Clause ‚Äì Tutorial

## üß† What is `TOP`?

The `TOP` clause in **T-SQL (SQL Server)** is used to **limit the number of rows** returned in a `SELECT` query.

> üîÑ It‚Äôs the SQL Server version of `LIMIT` (used in MySQL and PostgreSQL).

---

## ‚úÖ Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT TOP (number) column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column;
```

# üß† SQL `DISTINCT` ‚Äî Tutoring Session

## ‚úÖ What is `DISTINCT`?

`DISTINCT` is used in SQL to **remove duplicate values** from the result set of a `SELECT` query. It returns **only unique rows**.

---

## üîç Syntax

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

- If you use `DISTINCT` on **one column**, it removes duplicates in that column.
- If you use it on **multiple columns**, it keeps rows where the **entire combination** of values is unique.

---

## üéØ Example 1 ‚Äì Single Column

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City
FROM Person.Address;
```

This returns a list of **unique cities** in the `Address` table ‚Äî duplicates are removed.

---

## üéØ Example 2 ‚Äì Multiple Columns

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City, StateProvinceID
FROM Person.Address;
```

This returns unique **(City, StateProvinceID)** combinations.

Even if a city appears multiple times, if it's paired with a different state ID, it is counted as unique.

| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use when necessary                       | Avoid using `DISTINCT` to "fix" bad joins or queries             |
| Better indexing = better performance     | `DISTINCT` can be slow on large datasets without proper indexing |
| `DISTINCT` applies to the **entire row** | Not just one column unless used on only one                      |
| Not the same as `GROUP BY`               | `GROUP BY` can aggregate; `DISTINCT` only filters unique rows    |

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `DISTINCT column`     | Removes duplicates in that column            |
| `DISTINCT col1, col2` | Removes rows where both columns are the same |
| Use with caution      | Avoid overuse, can slow down queries         |
